OVERVIEW OF GAME
Tile Map Adventure is a 2D action-adventure game where players need to avoid enemies in a maze and collect points. The game's mechanism is relatively simple and easy for players to get started, including player movement, collision detection and point collection. 

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Basically I contributed to the development of game mechanics, including player movement and collision detection. My process involves implementing these features using JavaScript and the p5.js library. 

THEMES
The tone of the game I thought about is adventurous and light-hearted, encouraging players to enjoy the journey and embrace the thrill of discovery.

GAME DESIGN
The game design of Tile Map Adventure revolves around the concept of exploration and overcoming obstacles. Through maze-like levels and diverse challenges, players use the direction keys to explore every corner of the map while formulating action strategies to avoid enemies and collect points. In the final project, I plan to further develop these mechanics by introducing new levels of increasing complexity and introducing additional obstacles and abilities to enhance the gameplay experience. But I prefer to regard the game as being submitted as an introductory guide for players, because there are still many bugs that I think can be improved and fixed.

NARRATIVE
While Tile Map Adventure was primarily focused on game mechanics, incorporating narrative elements would enrich the player experience in the final project. my idea is that the  entire story will revolve around a brave adventurer traveling through a mysterious land, encountering various creatures and challenges along the way. Through subtle storytelling elements embedded in the game's environments and character interactions, players will escape the maze at the end of the playthrough.

AESTHETIC
The game's aesthetic is inspired by classic 2D games, designed in the shape of a maze.
